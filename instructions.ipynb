    "## Overview\n",
    "- Electricity demand forecasting using the data provided in a Google Colaboratory notebook.\n",
    "- The provided data consists of two types:\n",
    "  - electricity_demand.csv: Electricity demand values within the Kansai Electric Power (JP) jurisdiction.\n",
    "  - {location}.csv: Actual weather data for specific locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "- The forecasting target period is January 1, 2023, 00:00:00 â€“ December 31, 2023, 23:00:00.\n",
    "- Electricity demand values can only be used up until 23:00:00 of the day before the target date.\n",
    "- There are no restrictions on forecasting methods (choose methods available in the free-tier plan).\n",
    "- The use of additional data from libraries such as jpholiday is permitted.\n",
    "  - If additional libraries are used, include the installation command in the notebook (e.g., ! pip install pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Development for Electricity Demand Forecasting\n",
    "  - Justify the choice of method and, if applicable, describe any hypotheses regarding feature engineering.\n",
    "- Evaluation of Forecasting Performance Using Actual Data\n",
    "  - Specify and justify the selected evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- Error Analysis and Model Challenges\n",
    "- Discuss issues identified through error analysis.\n",
    "- Hypotheses for Accuracy Improvement\n",
    "  - Provide potential strategies for enhancing model performance.\n",
    "- Expected Benefits of Model Deployment\n",
    "  - Explain the potential impact and advantages of implementing the model.\n"
